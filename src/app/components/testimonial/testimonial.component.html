      maintaining application that was the main upstream of my app. I remember
      he had to tackle with a lot of legacy code - migrate to newer environment
      - and it was successful. He was always cooperative, willing to help, able
      to solve all challenges. It was pleasure to work with him."

      "I had been working with József at IBM for more than one year. At that
      time He was working as java backend developer and I was working there as
      IT Specialist. We built an application for IBM which integrated IBM
      subsidiary employee's data with IBM database. Although java was new for
      József, but he acquired the knowledge fast. He always delivered work in
      quality and in time. It was easy and fun working with him

      "I worked with Joci for a couple of years. I got to know him as a junior
      Java developer, but he developed a lot and quickly while we worked
      together. His curiosity and desire to learn always drives him forward. We
      have built a greenfield application together that handles the data of
      hundreds of thousands of employees, during which he performed very well
      and reliably in more serious tasks, in several areas of Java. He works
      great with frontend and backend technologies as well, alone or as part of
      a development team, in an Agile environment. I can definitely recommend
      him."
